-- psql looks like sql but still have some difference, need some reminder here

-- Create python function in psql, and in psql you can call this function
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/plpython-funcs.html

-- psql functions NOT supported by Redshift (so don't waste your time to call these functions): 
-- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_unsupported-postgresql-functions.html

-- NOTES
-- 1. Sometimes you select multiple columns but got an error saying the rows exceeds the block size in Redshift, this maybe because
-- you have chosen columns that have large space settings such as var(MAX). If you remove those colums may make a difference.
